J. Jones</a> last October.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b><a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/profiles/profile/4826.html">Jeff

San Francisco beat the San Diego Padres 8-2 Thursday night for a season-opening
three-game sweep.</b></font></p>

to eliminate the Giants in the first round of last year's NL playoffs, allowing
a fifth-inning double to Kent.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>&quot;That was not an issue before the game and it's not an
issue now,&quot; said Kent. &quot;I don't care. This has nothing to do with the
past.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>This time, San Francisco got to Jones for four runs and six
hits in five innings, dropping San Diego to 0-3 for the first time since 1994,
when the Padres lost their first four. It was Jones' first game since signing
with San Diego as a free agent.</b></font></p>

about that,&quot; said Ortiz, who spent Wednesday at home in bed fighting a
24-hour bug. &quot;For the most part, I was interested to see how things would
go. Our guys took a lot of good hacks off him last time. It was a matter of time
before we jumped on him.&quot;</b></font></p>
