(AP) _ Juan Uribe hit a bases-loaded triple and Larry Walker a two-run homer as
the Colorado Rockies won 9-5 Tuesday night over the San Diego Padres, who wasted
Tony Gwynn's first three-hit game of the season. <o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>Starter
Pedro Astacio (2-1) drove in two runs and limited the Padres to two runs and
five hits in six innings, and Todd Walker hit a solo homer. <o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>The
Rockies, who were swept by the Padres in a three-game series in Denver during
the season's first week, batted around in the seventh and scored five runs off
rookie reliever Brian Lawrence. <o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>Larry
Walker hit Lawrence's third pitch to right-center for his seventh homer, scoring
Todd Walker, who had three hits. With the bases loaded and one out, Uribe hit a
triple that skipped past Gwynn in right field. <o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>Gwynn went
3-for-5 _ missing the Padres' first cycle by a homer _ and was stranded at third
base three times, including after hitting his first triple since 1997. After
Gwynn flied out in his fourth at-bat, most of the crowd of 16,615 walked out. <o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>Gwynn, in
his 20th season, has 3,120 hits. He's coming off surgery on his left knee that
limited him to a career-low 36 games last year. <o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>Rickey
Henderson, called up from the minors by the Padres earlier in the day, singled
as a pinch-hitter in the ninth inning for his 2,915th career hit. <o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>Todd Walker
homered leading off the fifth off Bobby Jones (0-2) to break a 2-2 tie. Astacio
lined an RBI single to center in the sixth and also had a sacrifice bunt in the
fourth that tied the game at 2. <o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>Gwynn
doubled with one out in the first, tripled into the Rockies' bullpen in the
right-field corner with one out in the third and singled leading off the fifth. <o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>The double
was the 536th of his career, moving him out of a tie with Lou Gehrig and into
sole possession of 22nd on the all-time list. <o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>Gwynn's
triple was his first since July 14, 1997, against San Francisco, a span of 347
games. <o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>San Diego
took a 2-0 lead on one hit, two walks and an error by Astacio in the second
inning. Donaldo Mendez singled in Ben Davis, who scored when center fielder Juan
Pierre's one-hop throw got away from catcher Ben Petrick. <o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>Astacio
backed up the play but threw the ball into center field trying to get Mendez at
second, allowing Santiago Perez to score from second on the error. Todd Helton
singled in Colorado's first run in the third. <o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>Astacio
walked six and struck out five. Jones allowed four runs _ three earned _ on
eight hits in six innings. <o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>Davis hit a
two-run single during the Padres' three-run ninth. Jose Jimenez came in and
retired Bubba Trammell with two runners on for his fourth save.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>Notes: The
Padres put OF Mark Kotsay on the 15-day DL, retroactive to Monday with a left
quadriceps strain, to make room for Henderson. Triple-A shortstop Kevin
Nicholson was designated for assignment. ... Mendez was spiked by Todd Helton
near his left knee in the third inning, was treated in the dugout and returned
to the game. ... Colorado's Todd Hollandsworth tied a club record by homering in
three straight at-bats on Sunday, but failed to extend it when he singled in his
first at-bat Tuesday. ... Colorado reliever Joe Davenport who lives in nearby
Santee singled in his first major league at bat in the ninth</b></font>
