Mulder</a> stopped the losing, holding the Anaheim Angels hitless into the sixth
inning in Oakland's 6-3 victory, which stopped a seven-game skid.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>&quot;That's
the one great thing about youth,&quot; first baseman <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/profiles/profile/5386.html">Jason
Giambi</a> said. &quot;We're still having a good time and we keep pushing each
other, saying, 'Don't panic, everything's OK, we're going to be fine.' &quot;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>The
Athletics' largest deficit in the West last year was seven games, following a
loss to Detroit on Aug. 11. It took the A's 49 days to overtake the Mariners,
which they finally did with two games left.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>&quot;Being
that far out that late in the season last year, you'd have to be an eternal
pessimist to think that they're buried right now,&quot; Angels manager Mike
Scioscia said. &quot;I mean, I hope I'm wrong. I sure hope they're buried, but I
know that's not the case. They're going to be tough all year.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>Even if the
Athletics collapse entirely, it wouldn't be the first time the franchise has
underachieved trying to defend a division title. In 1993, they finished 26 games
behind and in seventh place. In 1991 they were fourth, 11 games out. In 1982
they were fifth, 25 games off the pace.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>&quot;There
was one point last year where we lost nine games in a row and still won the
division, so we'll be fine,&quot; Giambi said. &quot;The losing streak was just
a focal point because it's the beginning of the year.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>&quot;Even
I'm a little shocked at how we started out. But the biggest thing that's going
to help us out is the unbalanced schedule, and playing more games against teams
in our own division.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b><a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/profiles/profile/6344.html">Frank
Menechino</a> had a homer and three RBI to back Mulder (1-1), who allowed three
runs and five hits in six-plus innings. He struck out seven and walked none.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b><a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/profiles/profile/5449.html">Jason
Isringhausen</a> pitched a perfect ninth for his second save.</b></font></p>

Hill</a> each moved up a notch and <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/profiles/profile/6556.html">Shawn
Wooten</a> was dropped from second to seventh. Wooten broke up the no-hit bid
leading off the sixth with his first major league homer.</b></font></p>

Kennedy</a> singled and Salmon ended an 0-for-18 drought with a two-out single.

Oakland ahead 4-1.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>Bengie
Molina chased Mulder in the seventh with a one-out RBI double, trimming the
margin to 6-2, and <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/profiles/profile/5506.html">Jim
Mecir</a> threw a wild pitch and gave up an RBI single to Hill.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b><a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/profiles/profile/5995.html">Jarrod
Washburn</a>, scheduled to be the Angels' opening-day starter until he was
sidelined by strep throat, came off the disabled list and allowed six runs –
four earned – and 12 hits in 6 2/3 innings.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>&quot;I
felt pretty strong, so overall, I was pleased – just not with the
outcome,&quot; Washburn said. &quot;I made some bad pitches in critical
situations and I definitely wasn't as sharp as I wanted to be. I left some balls
up and made that bad pitch to Menechino.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b><a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/profiles/profile/6114.html">Eric
Chavez</a>, whose .197 average against left-handers last season was the lowest
in the AL, singled his first two times up against the left-handed Washburn. The
second hit came in the fourth inning, just before Menechino drove a 2-1 pitch
into the left-field bullpen for a 4-0 lead.</b></font></p>

Hernandez</a> greeted <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/profiles/profile/6308.html">Lou

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>After Long
and Hernandez opened the second inning with singles, the Athletics scored their
first two runs with the help of three consecutive shallow fly balls that fell
safely – including a popup by Chavez that landed between Anderson, the left
fielder, and shortstop <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/profiles/profile/4981.html">Benji
Gil</a>, loading the bases.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>Long scored
when Menechino's blooper eluded Gold Glove outfielder <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/profiles/profile/5634.html">Darin

ran under <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/profiles/profile/5484.html">Johnny
Damon</a>'s popup inside the right-field line for an error.</b></font></p>

double plays, seven with the bases loaded.</b></font>
