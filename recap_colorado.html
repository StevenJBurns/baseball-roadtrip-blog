months ago, gave up five hits in 8 1/3 scoreless innings as the Rockies opened
the season with an 8-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Monday.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>When he left the game following two straight walks in the
ninth, Hampton tipped his cap to acknowledge a standing ovation – his third of
the day.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>&quot;That was great,&quot; Hampton said. &quot;It was a
great gesture on their part. Hopefully it happens about 20, 25 more times.&quot;</b></font></p>

Walker</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/profiles/profile/4181.html">Larry

miserable for St. Louis starter <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/profiles/profile/4627.html">Darryl
Kile</a>.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>Kile, who is 11-15 with a 6.76 ERA at Coors Field, gave up
six runs and 11 hits in five innings. The performance was an improvement from a
year ago, when he surrendered 11 runs, eight earned, and eight hits in 1 2/3
innings in his lone appearance at the ballpark.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>&quot;This is not a bad place to pitch if you make good
pitches, and unfortunately, today I was in the middle of the plate and they hit
the ball hard,&quot; Kile said.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>&quot;His stuff was really live,&quot; St. Louis manager
Tony La Russa said. &quot;He had the velocity. Just in this league, location is
more important. He had good stuff. He just kept leaving it over the plate.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>Unlike Kile, Hampton does not rely heavily on a curveball
and proved for at least one game that he has the arsenal to pitch at altitude.
Of his 25 outs, 13 came on ground balls. He also had five strikeouts and made a
handful of athletic plays in the field.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>&quot;Great, great performance,&quot; Rockies manager Buddy
Bell said. &quot;Obviously, we don't need that every time out. He had some help,
but the energy he provides is something extra.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>The Rockies, whose $121 million, eight-year deal with
Hampton is the richest ever for a pitcher, are counting on more of the same
throughout the season as they compete in the pitching-rich NL West. Their other
top-line free-agent starter, <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/profiles/profile/4709.html">Denny
Neagle</a>, is scheduled to pitch Wednesday.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>&quot;You saw what Mike Hampton can do for a team,&quot;
said <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/profiles/profile/3866.html">Mark McGwire</a>,
who went 0-for-3 for St. Louis. &quot;He is a competitor and he gives you
everything on every pitch. If I am not mistaken, we were in the running for him.
We didn't get him.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>After Hampton pitched out of trouble in the first, Todd
Walker got Colorado off to a quick start when he hit a 3-1 pitch over the center
field wall to give the Rockies a 2-0 lead.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b><a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/profiles/profile/5231.html">Jeff
Cirillo</a>, who went 3-for-5, had a run-scoring double in the third and Todd
Walker added a two-out RBI double in the fourth as Hampton efficiently continued
his spell over St. Louis.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>During last year's National League Championship Series,
Hampton pitched 16 scoreless innings against the Cardinals to earn MVP honors
and help the New York Mets advance to the World Series.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Tahoma" size="1"><b>St. Louis had only one runner reach third base against
Hampton and went 0-for-5 with runners in scoring position.</b></font></p>

trying to do the same thing _ keep the ball on the ground and stay away from the
big innings,&quot; Hampton said.</b></font></p>
