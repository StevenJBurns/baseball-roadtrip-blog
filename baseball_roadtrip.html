    <p><i><span><b>&quot;The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball. America has rolled by like an army of steamrollers. It's been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt, and erased again. But baseball has marked the time. This field, this game, is a part of our past, Ray. It reminds us of all that once was good, and that could be again. Oh people will come, Ray. People will most definitely come.&quot;&nbsp; -- Field of Dreams</b></span></i></p>
    <p>Baseball Roadtrip is an idea I've had for ten years.&nbsp; Two college friends drove across the country stopping to see a handful of major league games in several cities in 1992.&nbsp; Since then I've tinkered with the idea of seeing a game in every major league ballpark around the country (and Canada).&nbsp; Time, money, circumstances, personal and professional obligations have kept me from starting out on this little adventure in the past but now it's begun.&nbsp; Come take a peek at where I'm at...</p>
