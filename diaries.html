    <h3><u>15 JAN 01</u></h3>
    <p>Happy MLK Day. Having tinkered with the Baseball Roadtrip idea for years and years, I gave it more thought last August when I was returning from a 100 day deployment overseas.&nbsp; I was going to take about two weeks and hit places like Arizona, Colorado, Kansas City, St Louis, Houston and Arlington but I never followed through.&nbsp; At the end of the season I&nbsp; told myself I'd make it happen in 2001 so I waited for the new schedule, looking and searching at least once a week on the internet with no success.&nbsp; Today I stumbled upon the fresh new 2001 schedule, hot off the press, with schedules for every team on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mlb.com/">Major League Baseball Official Web Site</a>. Excitement and euphoria have taken over and fortunately I have a friend, trusted agent, and fellow baseball fan in my buddy Tim Glynn. He's here in Little Rock, AR for the same ACQ upgrade school, flying C-130s out of Pennsylvania at Willow Grove JRB near Philadelphia.&nbsp; If the Roadtrip gets to the east coast I will surely have a wingman for those games.&nbsp; I have a very busy summer ahead with quite a few obligations,&nbsp; and</p>

    <p>This web site is coming under construction as I sit in my room at Little Rock AFB, AR on a Saturday night. I have only two or three weeks left here before getting back to Abilene, TX in mid-February.&nbsp; That is going to coincide with tickets going on sale for most teams, Colorado's Opening Day which could be urgent due to the Rockies record for sell outs and the opener will surely be sold out.&nbsp; That being said I have to solidify plans, balance the money situation, calculate spending, and tie up loose ends.&nbsp; Leaving Abilene for San Antonio and eventually Mississippi, time is not a luxury this summer.&nbsp; The flip side of the coin is that once I get to Columbus, MS the job of being a T-37 instructor pilot won't be as liberal for free time as the C-130 world has been. In fact I would bet for the next three years getting a block of time off for more than a week at a time won't be easy to do.</p>
