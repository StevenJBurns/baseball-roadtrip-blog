        <b><span>Welcome to my chunk of cyber-space dedicated to a thing I am calling Baseball Roadtrip 2001. I've been a fan of America's Pastime since I was five years old and over time I've become an all around fan and a purist&nbsp; &quot;for love of the game&quot; as they say.&nbsp; I will always root for the New York Mets when given the chance however!&nbsp; Being a fan is a 25 year work in progress and I probably always will be until I see my very last game (or there's another ridiculous strike).</span></b>

        <b><span>Roadtrip is an idea I've had for nearly nine years since two college friends drove across the country stopping to see a handful of major league games in several cities back in 1992.&nbsp; Since then I've tinkered with the idea of seeing a game in every major league ballpark around the country (including Canada!).&nbsp; Time, money, circumstances, procrastination, personal and professional obligations have kept me from starting out on this adventure but now it might just happen.&nbsp; The ambitious plan is to put a check mark next to every ballpark on the list over the course of just one season.&nbsp; The reality will probably be that I can't complete a tour of 30 ballparks in just six months in which case&nbsp;it will be a fluid thing.&nbsp; My busy schedule for the summer of 2001 already looks to conspire against me...</span></b>

      <p>A quote from James Earl Jones in the movie &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; sums up baseball, the roadtrip and all that is good about the game...</p>
      <p><i>The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball. America has rolled by like an army of steamrollers. It's been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt, and erased again. But baseball has marked the time. This field, this game, is a part of our past, Ray. It reminds us of all that once was good, and that could be again. Oh people will come, Ray. People will most definitely come.</i></p>
